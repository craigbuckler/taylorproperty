<blockquote>
<p>Mike is a professional, easy to work with, an effective communicator and lead builder/project manager whose experience adds value to your planned project. He brings ideas and options to your scheme, whilst not being imposing, and always listening to what you are trying to achieve. He is able to communicate what is feasible, what is challenging, and what may attract risk or uncertainty in terms of cost and time to projects, up front. From interpreting engineers drawings, to dealing with steel fabricators, suppliers, skilled trades people, and us, Mike is well connected with the right people and covers all bases exceptionally well.</p>

<p>We are extremely impressed with how he and his team worked during the project. Everyone was always on time, always professional, tidy, efficient and highly skilled. We now have a beautiful open plan home, new shower room, boiler/drying room and bespoke electrical installations that suit our needs entirely.</p>

<p>Mike and his team were exceptional. We would not hesitate to recommend him, unreservedly, to anyone in need of professional building/property construction, improvements and maintenance. Thank you.</p>
